# 🛡️ Harshil Ramoliya — Cybersecurity / Blue Team Portfolio

This repository hosts my **personal cybersecurity portfolio website**, designed to showcase my experience and approach as a **Blue Team–focused Security Operations professional**.

The site is intentionally built as a **static, performance-optimized, and security-conscious portfolio**, aligned with how real-world production security teams present systems: clean architecture, no exposed secrets, and minimal attack surface.

## 🧱 Technical Design Choices

### Static Architecture

* Built using **HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript**
* Hosted via **GitHub Pages**
* No backend, databases, or server-side logic

This keeps the site:

* Fast
* Reliable
* Easy to audit
* Low maintenance

---

### 🔒 Security-Conscious Frontend

The deployed version of the site is:

* **Minified and obfuscated**
* Free of comments and readable structure
* Optimized to discourage casual copying

> Note: As with all client-side web applications, frontend code must be delivered to the browser. The portfolio follows **industry-standard frontend protection practices** rather than attempting unrealistic code hiding techniques.

### 🎨 Design Philosophy

The visual design intentionally reflects a **Blue Team / defensive security mindset**:

* Calm blue color palette
* Layered, shield-like geometry
* Subtle motion representing continuous monitoring
* No "hacker-style" visuals or aggressive effects

The goal is to communicate:

> Stability · Control · Visibility · Reliability
